In this analysis I analized the sales about different gadgets products.
I did the data cleaning process dropping the unnecessary null values, checking the duplicated values so I dropped them as well, checking the data columns.
It was necesary to extract the information from a column to get the month data so with that information I created a new column for Month data
I changed the data types to continue with the analysis
I used the technique groupby to do important analysis to make graphs of sales by month
I did data manipulation to extract the cities of the column Purchase Address then I created a pie chart to show the frequency count for each city
I created a table and a graph to show quantity ordered and price of each of the products
After this I created a new data frame to show the most sold products
I continue with a graph to show the most sold items per month
I grouped by products by the the order ID, then I merged two data frames
Finally I did a pie chart about the most sold products grouped products by ID.
